# Summer of Science 2025 – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (CS01)

Welcome to my repository for the **Summer of Science 2025** program under the **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** track. This repo documents all my weekly learning, hands-on experiments, and mini-projects developed as part of the structured curriculum.

---

## Overview

This repository contains structured code and reports corresponding to the **Week 1 to Week 8** roadmap of the program. It follows a curated set of topics from foundational machine learning to practical implementations in Python.

- Hands-on: Implemented linear regression (one/multiple features), gradient descent

### 🔹 Week 2 – Linear Models & Dimensionality Reduction
- Concepts: Multivariate regression, Ridge, Lasso, PCA
- Hands-on: Regularized regression, PCA visualization, feature selection

### 🔹 Week 3 – Classification and Clustering
- Concepts: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means Clustering, Perceptron
- Projects:
  - 📩 `spam_classifier.ipynb` – Spam detection using TF-IDF and logistic regression  
  - 🍷 `wine_classifier.ipynb` – Classification of wine quality using KNN & logistic regression  
  - 🎨 `color_extractor.ipynb` – Dominant color detection in images using K-Means

### 🔹 Week 4 – Neural Networks and Tree-Based Models
- Concepts: Perceptron, MLPs, Backpropagation, Decision Trees
- Hands-on: Decision Tree Classifier (with pruning), Evaluation metrics (F1, Confusion Matrix)

### 🔹 Week 5–8 (Upcoming)
- Ensemble methods: Bagging, Boosting, Random Forests
